                    <p class="par">      
                        I am a medium length, brown eye final year BSc Information and knowledge systems student at the Universtity of Pretoria.
                         I identify as a male and online personality tests have placed me next to great minds like <b>Arnold Schwarzenegger</b> and <b>Elon Musk</b>.
                    </p><p class="parTwo">  This means I have a very strong personality which tends to lead to arguments and complications in group projects. It is my passion to take charge and lead from the front.
                    </p>
                    <p class="parThree"> But I possess great leadership abilities so this counters the problems I face with my strong personality.

                <p >
                        What you think you become is a very important qoute in my life. Positive thinking ensures that you are a positive person. Thus my thinking revolves around software engineering and development in the hopes that I become this after receiving my degree.
                        My skills include the following programming languages and paradigms:
                </p>        <ul>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>C++</li>
                            <li>C#</li>
                            <li>ASP.net</li>
                            <li>Web development including Node.js, PHP and React</li>
                            <li>Android application development</li>
                            <li>Database Management</li>

            <p class="par2" >
                Apart from the fact that University (lectures, practicals and assignments) take up most of my time I still try and find a balance. Most of my weeks days I spend by working out right after waking up then preceding to go to class
                for the day. At night I tend to do assignments and practicals. </p>
              <p class="par2"> Weekends are there to try and catch up on my social life aswell as partake in my weekly <b>Call Of Duty</b> scrim tournaments. This is also the time I try and work on the bags under my eyes and current relationships.
                But do not be fooled work still takes place in this time.
